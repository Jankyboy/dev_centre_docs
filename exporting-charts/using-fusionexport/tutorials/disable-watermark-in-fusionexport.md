Now, letâ€™s check out the basic steps to remove the watermarks from your exported chart.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have:

1. [Downloaded and installed FusionExport Server](/exporting-charts/using-fusionexport/installation/install-fusionexport-server), and the server is running

2. [Downloaded and installed the FusionExport SDK client](/exporting-charts/using-fusionexport/installation/install-fusionexport-server-sdks)

3. [Export a Dashboard](/exporting-charts/using-fusionexport/installation/export-a-dashboard)

## Remove FusionExport Watermark

To remove FusionExport watermark, you need to purchase the licensed version. Contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@fusioncharts.com) to purchase the license. Once you have purchased the license, run the licensed package and export; FusionExport watermark will go away.

The exported chart without the FusionExport trail mark looks like as shown below:

## Remove FusionCharts Trial mark

To remove the FusionCharts watermark, you have to buy a FusionCharts licensed version and use the downloaded files as a custom library. You can either contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@fusioncharts.com) or go to our [pricing page](https://www.fusioncharts.com/buy) to download the licensed package of FusionCharts.

You can override the default package version of **FusionCharts** in **FusionExport** with your current version by passing your custom FusionCharts directory to the `-L` options of FusionExport.

```bash
./fusionexport -L <path_to_fusioncharts_lib>
```

To remove the FusionCharts watermark, follow the steps below:

- Copy all the files in the `js` folder of your licensed distribution.
- Place all the files present inside the `js` folder in a folder named `fusioncharts` beside your `fusionexport` file.

To run licensed FusionExport with licensed FusionCharts run:

```bash
./fusionexport -L fusioncharts/
```

After removing the watermarks, the chart looks like:

## Remove trial mark in Docker

As mentioned earlier, to remove FusionExport watermark, you need to purchase the licensed version. Contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@fusioncharts.com) to purchase the license. They will be sharing a Docker package where watermark is not present. Once you have purchased the license, run the licensed package and export; FusionExport watermark will go away.

However, in case of FusionCharts there is a slight change in the configuration you have to do.

Get the licensed FusionCharts files. You can contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@fusioncharts.com) or go to our [pricing page](https://www.fusioncharts.com/buy) to download the licensed package of FusionCharts. Keep it in your system location and get the location path where you have copied the folder.

Go to `fusionexport-docker` package that you downloaded from our website. Open `fusionexport-docker/docker-composer.yml` and add an entry in the `volume` section:

```
fusionexport:
    build:
      context: ./service
    volumes:
      - ${DATA_SAVE_PATH}/exported_images:/app/exported_images
      - /Downloads/fusioncharts-suite/js:/app/fusioncharts
    ports:
      - "${SERVICE_PORT}:1337"

```

As you can see above, in our local system FusionCharts library is present in `/Downloads/fusioncharts-suite/js`. In your case, use the appropriate location. The same folder is mounted in `/app/fusioncharts` inside Docker container. You can choose any location you want.

Now open the `config.json` file inside the `fusionexport-docker/service/config.json` and change the `libraryDirectoryPath`  value to `/app/fusioncharts`.

```json
{
  "server": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 1337,
    "logEnabled": true,
    "allowSave": true,
    "savePath": "exported_images",
    "workerCount": 2,
    "libraryDirectoryPath": "/app/fusioncharts"
  }
}
```

That is it. Now restart Docker by running following command and you are done.

```bash
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```
