We're thrilled to unveil the latest release of FusionCharts, version 4.0.0, FusionGrid v2.0, and FusionExport 2.1 introducing a suite of new enhancements designed to make  user experience smoother, more efficient, and more enjoyable.

A standout feature in this release is the introduction of **AI-powered knowledge base and documentation assistant** for development teams seeking to accelerate time-to-market and boost efficiency, `FusionDev AI` provides instant, context-aware answers, and automated code generation, empowering developers to focus on delivering innovative solutions, faster.

Key improvements include new attributes for the `Gantt` Chart to make the user experience more efficient, resolving `resizeTo` issues guaranteeing seamless chart resizing, improving the visual clarity of Multi-series Bar charts by addressing `transposeAxis` attribute bug, and much more. Additionally, we upgraded the framework integrations for `React`, `Angular`, `Vue`, and `Svelte`.
