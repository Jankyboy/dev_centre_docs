## Resizing for Gauges

FusionCharts 3.20 updated the map of India to showcase Ladakh as a separate region. The Entity of Ladakh is now shown as a distinct region from Jammu and Kashmir. For more details, see [Ladakh map](https://www.fusioncharts.com/fusionmaps).

## Set the time format for the Time Navigator

FusionCharts 3.19 updated the value for `mintendency` in order to fix the tendency issue, causing the chart not to plot all datasets correctly when some datasets contained zero as values. Now, charts display all dataset plots despite the amount and values of the datasets.

## Remove scrollbar from legend container

FusionCharts version 3.19 improves the chart readability by allowing users to define the width of the Legend container. In addition, this option allows users to display the legend container without any scrollbars, therefore displaying all the information.
