This section is for users who are using the previous version of FusionCharts in their application. Here, we'll talk about the new features introduced in v3.20.x.


## Update for Ramda Support

To improve our security, FusionCharts release 3.21 updated the ´Ramda´ dependency package from version 0.25.0 to version 0.29.0. 


## Cross-Site Scripting

FusionCharts version 3.21 implemented the new function to eliminate any javascript functions in your code that may cause an error. The new function removes any HTML-based predefined javascript functions (like onError, onClick, Onchange, etc.) from the code and lets the charts and images display smoothly.  


## New Maps

FusionCharts version 3.21 introduces new maps for Argentina, Peru, and Costa Rica. With a total of 58 new maps, you can now drill down to each specific department within those countries. This version added all 27 Peruvian departments, all 24 Argentinian departments, and all seven Costa Rican departments.
