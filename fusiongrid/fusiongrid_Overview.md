FusionGrid provides a data grid component that is highly customizable and blends nicely with your website or mobile application. This data grid allows you to display millions of records with filtering, sorting, and grouping capabilities.

FusionGrid is an enterprise-class, JavaScript-based data grid component created to deliver a fast and feature-rich data visualization experience.

It is lightweight and customizable, and it works with both web and mobile applications. It allows you to build data grids in dashboards with the same simplicity and elegance as FusionCharts. The goal of FusionGrid is to provide an intuitive, clean, easy-to-use, and fully responsive data grid solution that works seamlessly on all modern browsers. FusionGrid offers unparalleled flexibility and power with blazing speed and superior quality with an array of features under its belt.

You get out-of-the-box features like Column Filter, Data Export, Row Selection, Column Grouping, Real-time Data Update, Row Sorting, and Search/Quick Filter. And the best part is that you can use it on desktop, tablet, and mobile through responsive layouts without any additional effort on your end.

## Package Structure 

There are two primary components of FusionGrid: 
1. FusionGrid Server
2. FusionGrid SDKs

## FusionGrid Server
Run FusionGrid server on your backend infrastructure and start constructing your Grid. We support Windows, Mac, and Linux, so you don't have to worry about cross-platform integration.

## FusionGrid SDK
Once you start the FusionGrid server on your system,  we will learn how FusionDataStore works.  FusionDataStore provides in-memory relational database management. It is the gridâ€™s backbone to manage data, and it is already supported in FusionTime. There is comprehensive documentation available on using it in the (Dev Center)[/dev/fusiontime/fusiontime-data-engine/overview]. If you are interested in more detail, we highly recommend you go through it.
