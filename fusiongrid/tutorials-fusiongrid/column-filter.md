For a better data analysis you can apply filters on specific columns to show most relevant data first. There are four types of filters you can apply to your grid.

### Prerequisites

Before starting with the code, ensure that you have:

- Downloaded and installed FusionGrid Server(link), and the server is running

## Conditional Filter
Use conditions and logical operations to filter your data. 

## Value Filter 
In a value filter a value list opens up in the filter modal allowing user to select and deselect the values to set the filter.
