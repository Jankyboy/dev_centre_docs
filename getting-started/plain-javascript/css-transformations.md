CSS Transformations help you change the visual appearance of charts so you can present them in a more interesting way. CSS transformations could be specially useful on the sports broadcasting industry, or in situations where you want to fit charts with other visuals.

Charts are compatible with the following transformations:

+ rotate (only rotateZ)
+ skew 
+ skewX
+ skewY
+ scale
+ scaleX
+ scaleY
+ translate
+ translateX
+ translateY
+ matrix
